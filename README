Some web-scrapers to be able to monitor product prices on main online shopping platforms.
In particular : scrape_ali is a scraper for Aliexpress products, which gets product links from a file named "ali_products.csv" 
and fills "ali_prices.csv" with results.
scrape_amazon performs same actions ( with different implementation caused by different website layout management ), respectively
with "amazon_products.csv" and "amazon_prices.csv".
Temp.js is necessary to extract JSON from Aliexpress page.
